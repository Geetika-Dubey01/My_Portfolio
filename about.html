  <p>
    I am a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). I enjoy creating clean,
    responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I am continuously improving
    my problem-solving skills and understanding of core computer science concepts.
    Currently, I am learning the MERN stack to gain knowledge of full-stack web
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in continuous learning and improving my skills step by step.
    I like exploring new technologies and understanding how different tools
    and frameworks work together to build scalable applications. Along with
    technical skills, I focus on writing clean code, following best practices,
    and improving user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am also working on improving my communication and teamwork skills,
    as I believe collaboration plays a key role in successful software
    development. I am open to internship and entry-level opportunities where
    I can learn from experienced professionals, contribute to real projects,
    and grow both technically and personally.
